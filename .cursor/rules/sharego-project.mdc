# ShareGo project context

ShareGo is a serverless, end-to-end encrypted, local-network-only app for securely sharing sensitive data (passwords, OTPs, text) between exactly 2 devices on the same Wi-Fi.

## Supported platforms

- Desktop: Windows, macOS, Linux (Tauri)
- Mobile: Android, iOS (React Native bare)

## Architecture invariants (never violate these)

1. No cloud servers, no TURN, no signaling, no relay
2. Same Wi-Fi / local network only
3. Exactly 2 participants per session, no late join
4. Receiver creates session, sender joins
5. All crypto uses libsodium — no platform-specific crypto APIs
6. Ephemeral keys only — never persist secrets to disk
7. QR and manual code are bootstrap only — never data channels

## Repo layout

- `core/src/crypto/` — libsodium wrappers (keygen, exchange, encrypt, decrypt)
- `core/src/protocol/` — message types, serialization, QR payload
- `core/src/session/` — session state machine, lifecycle, events
- `core/src/transport/` — ILocalTransport interface, WebSocketTransport
- `apps/desktop-tauri/` — Tauri shell (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- `apps/mobile-rn/` — React Native bare (Android, iOS)
- `docs/` — ARCHITECTURE.md, PROTOCOL.md, THREAT_MODEL.md, REJECTED.md

## Key design rules

- All security logic lives in `@sharego/core` — app shells are thin wrappers
- Transport is pluggable via `ILocalTransport` interface
- Every message is typed via the `ProtocolMessage` union
- Session state transitions are explicit and validated
- Comments should be lowercase and only added when they explain *why*, not *what*
